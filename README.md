Clients App
=======

__Clients__ is a time tracking software built in PHP for solo entrepreneurs who charge hourly or bid by the project.

## Installation

After cloning this repository, you still need to do two things in order to fully configure your instance of this application:

1. Retrieve the [config class](https://github.com/martynchamberlin/ConfigClass) and plug in your database credentials.
2. Import the SQL file located inside this repository's `sql` directory.

## Notes

A live, working version of this applicaton is viewable at [clients.perfectioncoding.com](clients.perfectioncoding.com). I use this application every week, often multiple times per day. This GitHub respository is what I use to synchronize with the live server so there are never any discrepancies. Enjoy!

## Wishlist

The main piece of functionality that I've yet to build out is password retrieval. For the time being, don't forget your password. :-)
